Low Poly Archer is my first game made in Unity.
  

My first steps:  
  - I started by programming the controls to make it look good.
  - Then I created a model of the valley where the first stairs appeared because the game was supposed to be low poly and this strukure can only be achieved in another       program such as Blender. The problem was when I wanted to convert "obj" to terren using code
    the program has rounded off the sharp model.
  - I Added bunch of animation to Player like :
    - Moving, Runnig, Jumping.
    - Crouching.
    - Moving with Bow and Shooting animation.
    - Attacking with sword animation
  - Next i added equpment bow sword and shoting and sword mechanic.
  - Then i added basic trannig ragdoll taking damage.
  - And for a end i added small inventory UI with complityl working adding item to slot.
